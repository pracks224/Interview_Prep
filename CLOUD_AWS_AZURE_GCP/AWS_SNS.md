### FIFO Topic 

1. Topic name should suffix with .fifo
2.  FIFO topics receives the message with deduplication id from the publisher and checks the same deduplicayion id then discards it
3.  Also, FIFO topic ensures ordering using group id ,If any message comes with group id then it mantians the order or else it publish concurrently.

### Limitations of SNS

-  Rate limit (FIFO topic 300 transaction per sec but standrad has limit though .Still limited)
-  Subscription Limit (Max 10,000)
-  Size of the message (256 KB)
-  Message retention : SNS does not retain messages. Once a message is delivered to all subscribers (or the maximum delivery attempts are reached), it is permanently deleted. This means you cannot re-read or replay messages after delivery.
