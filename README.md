# 60-Day Roadmap to AI/ML Engineer with Java Full-Stack, Cloud (AWS), Data Engineering, and DevOps

## Day 1: 12th January - Java 8 Features

### Objectives:
- Understand key Java 8 features such as Lambda Expressions, Streams API, Optional, Default Methods, and Date/Time API.
- Begin exploring AI/ML basics, focusing on Linear Algebra and Statistics, and starting with Python.

### Tasks for the Day:
- **Lambda Expressions**: Study functional programming concepts in Java.
  - Understand how Lambda Expressions simplify the code.
  - Practice with functional interfaces like `Function`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`, and `Predicate`.
- **Streams API**: Learn how to manipulate collections and perform operations on them in a declarative way using Streams.
  - Filter, map, and reduce collections with Streams.
- **Optional Class**: Learn how to handle null values effectively in Java using the Optional class.
- **Date and Time API**: Familiarize yourself with the modern Date and Time API (`LocalDate`, `ZonedDateTime`, etc.) in Java 8.
- **AI/ML Foundations**: Start reviewing the basics of Linear Algebra, Probability, and Statistics.
  - Install Python and essential libraries like `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`.
