 ## About me

Hello, my name is Prakash. I am in the process of creating a repository to store all of my interview questions in one central location. This will allow me to better prepare for future interviews and keep track of the questions I have been asked in the past. I believe that this will also help me to identify patterns and areas where I may need to improve my skills. Thank you for your assistance in helping me to achieve this goal.

## Data Structure Using Java

<details>
  <summary>Scramble String </summary>
  
  ### Algorithm
  Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false.

  ### Some Details
  ```
  Input: s1 = "great", s2 = "rgeat"
Output: true
Explanation: One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
"great" --> "gr/eat" // divide at random index.
"gr/eat" --> "gr/eat" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
"gr/eat" --> "g/r / e/at" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
"g/r / e/at" --> "r/g / e/at" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
"r/g / e/at" --> "r/g / e/ a/t" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide "at" to "a/t".
"r/g / e/ a/t" --> "r/g / e/ a/t" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is "rgeat" which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.
