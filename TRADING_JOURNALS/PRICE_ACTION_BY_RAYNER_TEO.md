TWO VERY IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER

9. Higher lows into resistance are a sign of strength
   — This looks something like an ascending triangle. It’s a sign of strength because it tells you buyers are willing to buy at higher prices (despite the price being near resistance).

10. Lower highs into support are a sign of weakness
    — This looks like a descending triangle. It’s a sign of weakness because it tells you sellers are willing to sell at lower prices (despite the price being near support).
