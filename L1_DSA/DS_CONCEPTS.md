#### Array (Easy) :

1. Good Pair
2. Pick From Both Sides
3. Range Sum Query
4. Rotation of Array
   Q.1) Count of Pairs with sum = K

Q.2) Given an ArrayList of integers, return all the unique numbers in the ArrayList.

Q.3) Given a matrix, row index =0, return sum of that particular row.

Q.4) Given a 2D array and a column index, return sum of that particular column.

Q.5) Write a function to add two matrix of same dimension and return the resultant

Q.6) Given an array A of N integers. Count the number of elements that have at least 1 elements greater than itself.

Q.7) Given an array of size N, shift all the elements to the right by 1 and move the last element to the beginning of array

#### String (Easy) :

Q.1) [Reverse a String using Recursive](DSA/src/ArrayString)

Q.2) [Find GCD using Recursive](DSA/src/ArrayString)

Q.3) [You are given a string A. Find the number of substrings that start and end with 'a'.](DSA/src/ArrayString)

Q.3) [Return an integer denoting the minimum characters needed to be inserted in the
beginning to make the string a palindrome string.](DSA/src/ArrayString)

Q.4) [Boring SubString -> Both the characters are consecutive, for example - "ab", "cd", "dc", "zy"
and length should be 2. If no boring substring possible return 1
S = "abcd" -> cadb -> in this no boring substring hence return 1](DSA/src/ArrayString)

Q.5) [Closest Palindrome -> Return Yes if string can be converted to palindrom by changing
one character.](DSA/src/ArrayString)

### Miscllenaous

44. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
    cannot use additional data structures? (Bitwise way to understand)
45. One string permutaion of other
46. URLfy of String (Yet to Solve) %%%%%%%%% %%%%% All below %%%%%% %%%%%%%
47. Palindrom Permutation
48. One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
    remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
    one edit (or zero edits) away.
    EXAMPLE
    pale, ple -> true
    pales, pale -> true
    pale, bale -> true
    pale, bae -> false

49. String compression For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3
50. String Rotation: Assume you have a method i 5Su b 5 tr ing which checks if one word is a substring
    of another. Given two strings, 51 and 52, write code to check if 52 is a rotation of 51 using only one
    call to i5Sub5tring (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of"erbottlewat").
