- It's the extension of Micro service, Domain driven and can independently deployed
- Technology agnostic ,apps can be built on differnt framewroks like angular,react,vue etc 1.<a id="1"></a>
- Medium to Large web project, productivit first and handle few overheads .
- Must have automation ready 2.<a id="2"></a>
- Small project, now also single page and server side rendering always a good option 3.<a id="3"></a>
  The advantages of Micro Frontends are:
- Fast delivery due to isolated deployments
- Fast development cycle due to flexible tech stack and simple codebase
- Improved maintainability and testability due to a small codebase

Scalable development due to autonomous teams

Low initial load time because Micro Frontends get loaded on demand

High reliability because modules are independent

A low entry barrier for new developers due to small codebase and bounded context

A decoupled system due to distributed architecture

Low coupling due to explicit data flow between different parts of the application

Easy rollback with a version switch

Faster product feedback via incremental upgrades on the parts of the app

Easy to update or rewrite parts of the Frontend

Easy to experiment with new technology in an isolated way
