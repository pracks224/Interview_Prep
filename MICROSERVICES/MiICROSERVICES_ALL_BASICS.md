### Q.Conway's Law [TOP](#ms-top)

Conway's Law states that the structure of an organization will influence the design of the systems they create. In the context of microservices, this means that the communication and interaction patterns between teams within an organization will shape how the microservices architecture is designed and organized.

For example, if an organization's teams are divided based on specific business domains (e.g., payments, user management), the resulting microservices architecture is likely to reflect this division. Each team may own and develop microservices that align with their domain expertise, leading to a decentralized architecture where services are organized around business capabilities.

Conversely, if teams are organized around technical layers (e.g., frontend, backend), the microservices architecture might reflect a more layered approach, where services are organized based on their technical responsibilities.

In essence, Conway's Law emphasizes that the communication structures within organizations impact the architecture and design decisions of the systems they build, including microservices architectures.


### Q.SAGA PATTERN
#### Ans 
- It's an ingenious solution to manage the transactions in the world of distributed systems or Microsrvices.
- In a monolithic application, this transaction would usually be handled using ACID transactions
- In the simplest terms, a saga is a sequence of local transactions. Each local transaction updates the database and publishes an event to trigger the next local transaction in the saga
- The Saga Execution Coordinator(SEC) is the central component to implement a Saga flow.
- It contains a Saga log that captures the sequence of events of a distributed transaction.
- For any failure, the SEC component inspects the Saga log to identify the impacted components and the sequence in which the compensating transactions should run.
- For any failure in the SEC component, it can read the Saga log once itâ€™s coming back up.
- It can then identify the transactions successfully rolled back, which ones are pending, and can take appropriate actions
- Two ways : 1. choreography and orchestration

In the Saga Choreography pattern, each microservice that is part of the transaction publishes an event that is processed by the next microservice. Suitable for fewer services.

- Tools for Choregraphy -Axon,Microprofile,Seata
- In the Orchestration pattern, a single orchestrator is responsible for managing the overall transaction status.
- Tools for Orchestrator - Camunda, Apache Camel

### Data Consistency In Micro Services [TOP](#ms-top)

[source](https://dilfuruz.medium.com/data-consistency-in-microservices-architecture-5c67e0f65256)

- Data Consitency challenging in micro services as we have databse per service compared to monolithic where db is central
- To manage distributed transaction , in case of MSs we have multiple approach
  ### 2Phase Commit
  - Ensures Tight consistecny but latency is more becoz of blocking nature . And Single point of failure becoz of the transaction coordinator.Based on ACID
  - Eventual Cositency
    - It follows BASE (Basically Available,Soft-State,Eventual COnsistency)
    - SAGA is the common pattern to acgeive the ES
    - Two types Choreography-based -> Uses EVENT SOURCING for each events
      Orchestration based -> Compensation action if it fails
      Framewrok supports SAGA => Apache Camel ,Camunda



### Event-Sourcing [TOP](#ms-top)

### Q. [Caching in Microservices?](https://medium.com/@ashishteotia/types-of-caching-in-microservices-a68455ba8c45)
#### Ans
- Caching is temporrary storing in memory for faster retreival.
- Cache HIT ~~> If data already exist
- Cache MISS ~~~> If data does not exist
- What is Cache Eviction Policy ~~~> As cache data is temporray, It has to evict certain data as per some policy.
- - LRU - Least Recently Used
  - LFU - Least Frequently Used
  - MRU - Most Recently Used
  - FIFO
  - LIFO
- Types of Caching
  - Embedded Cache -> Most simplest cache, priavte to the running instance. Problem when multiple instances present for the same service. To resolve it used event listners to updated other instance caches
  - Client-Server Cache -> Centralized Cache
  - Distributed Cache/Cloud Cache -> Multiple CS cache
  - Side Car Cache -> Two container : In Sidecar Cache a separate container image is also spin-up with the application image and both the containers are isolated from each other.
  - Reverse Proxy Cache :
    In Reverser Proxy Caching the API response of a request which was served earlier by any underlying service is saved in the cache associated with API gateway or Reverse proxy. So when the same request hits the gateway it will be served from the gateway itself instead of hitting the underlying micro-services.

 



### Q. [How to Scale Microservice?](https://medium.com/cloud-native-daily/scaling-microservices-a-comprehensive-guide-200737d75d62)
- Ans
  - A Stateless Services: Ensure services donâ€™t store session data; scale horizontally with ease.
  - B Externalized Storage: Use cloud-native DBs (e.g., RDS, Firestore) and caches (e.g., Redis)
  - C Leverage Auto-Scaling: Kubernetes HPA: Auto-scales pods based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.Cloud Auto-Scaling: Use provider-managed scaling for VMs, containers.
  - D Use Managed Services Databases & Queues: Use AWS Aurora, SQS, Pub/Sub to reduce ops overhead.
  - E Istio/Linkerd: Handle load balancing, retries, traffic shaping, and circuit breakers.
  - F Event-Driven Architecture : Message Brokers: Kafka, SQS, or Kinesis enable asynchronous scaling. && Serverless: Use AWS Lambda or GCP Functions for on-demand, stateless tasks.
  - G Caching : In-Memory/Edge: Use Redis/Memcached and CDNs (CloudFront, Cloudflare) to reduce load.
  - H IaC : Automation: Use Terraform or CloudFormation to automate and replicate scaling setups.
  - I Observilibity: Monitoring: Use Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch for metrics and alerts. && Tracing: Track service calls with Jaeger or Zipkin to identify bottlenecks.
  









1A -
Monolithic more tightly coupled, microservice more flexible,scalable,mantaibility

4J -

To handle latency issues, implement caching to reduce repeated computations, use asynchronous communication and message queues, optimize database queries, compress data transfers, implement load balancing, and monitor network performance. Deploying services closer to users via CDNs or edge computing also minimizes latency.

10A -

Package the library in a shared repository like Maven Central, Nexus, or Artifactory for easy distribution.
Services can then include the library as a dependency using build tools like Maven or Gradle.

# 9A - Define Boundary

Defining the boundaries of a microservice is a critical step in designing a microservices architecture. Proper boundaries ensure that each microservice is cohesive, loosely coupled, and aligned with the overall business goals. Hereâ€™s how you can identify and define these boundaries, followed by an example:

Key Steps to Identify and Define Microservice Boundaries
Understand Business Domains:

Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to identify the core, supporting, and generic domains.
Break down the business into subdomains, each representing a specific area of responsibility.
Follow the Single Responsibility Principle:

Each microservice should focus on one specific functionality or responsibility within the system.
Avoid overloading a service with unrelated tasks.
Design Around Business Capabilities:

Align services with business capabilities rather than technical layers.
Example: "Order Management" or "Payment Processing" rather than "Database Service."
Bounded Contexts:

In DDD, a bounded context represents the scope within which a model applies.
Each bounded context maps to a microservice.
Analyze Data Ownership:

Define which microservice owns a particular piece of data.
Avoid sharing databases directly between services to maintain independence.
Consider Autonomy and Scalability:

A microservice should be independently deployable and scalable.
Group functionalities that scale together into one service.
Handle Cross-Cutting Concerns Separately:

Centralize concerns like logging, monitoring, and authentication into shared libraries or infrastructure services, not core microservices.
Use Event Storming or Process Analysis:

Map out the entire workflow of the application and identify the events that trigger specific processes.
Group related processes into separate services.
Example: E-commerce Application
Business Requirements:
An e-commerce platform has the following functionalities:

User Management: Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
Product Catalog: Manages the list of products, their categories, and details.
Order Management: Processes orders, including creation, updates, and cancellations.
Payment Service: Handles payment processing and integration with third-party payment gateways.
Inventory Service: Tracks product stock levels and updates them in real time.
Shipping Service: Manages shipping logistics and tracks delivery status.
Applying Microservices Boundaries:
Bounded Contexts:

User Management: Owns data related to user accounts and authentication.
Product Catalog: Manages product details and metadata.
Order Management: Responsible for order creation and status updates.
Payment Service: Focuses on payment processing, payment status, and refunds.
Inventory Service: Handles stock availability and replenishment.
Shipping Service: Manages shipping labels, carriers, and delivery tracking.
Independence:

Each service has its own database. For example:
User Management: UserDB (Relational DB like MySQL or PostgreSQL).
Product Catalog: ProductDB (NoSQL like MongoDB for flexibility).
Order Management: OrderDB (Relational DB).
Communication happens through APIs or events, not shared databases.
Scalability:

Services that experience high traffic can scale independently. For instance:
Product Catalog may scale to handle browsing traffic.
Payment Service may scale during peak sales.
Communication:

Use asynchronous messaging for event-driven communication.
Example:
When an order is placed, the Order Management service emits an event that the Inventory and Shipping services consume to update stock and create a shipping order.

4A -

- A bounded context is a clear boundary within which a particular domain model is defined and applicable. In microservices, it ensures that each service has a well-defined scope, preventing overlapping responsibilities and promoting decoupled and cohesive services. This leads to better scalability, maintainability, and team autonomy.

  - **Use Case Example:** In an e-commerce system, "Order Management" and "Inventory Management" are separate bounded contexts. The "Order Management" service tracks customer orders, while the "Inventory Management" service maintains stock levels. Each service operates independently with its own data model, reducing coupling and simplifying scalability.

2E -

1. CQRS is a design pattern that separates the responsibility for handling commands (updates queries) from queries (reads). In microservices, it improves performance and scalability by using distinct models or services for read and write operations. For example, an e-commerce system might use a write model for processing orders and a read model for querying order details.

2. Basically create two services and use messagingto be in sync between these two command database and read database.

3. CQRS helps writing complex queries, securtty feature for write effectivly by avoidingthe read opertaions etc. Example on Sale day of amzon 30% write n 70% read so ithelps segregate the load effectivly.

1C - Microservices achieve horizontal scalability by deploying multiple instances of individual services across distributed servers or containers. Load balancers distribute incoming traffic among these instances, ensuring high availability and performance. Since each service is independently scalable, resources can be allocated based on demand, optimizing system efficiency.

4C - Sticky sessions are a load balancing mechanism where a user's requests are always routed to the same server instance during a session. While this can simplify session state management, it reduces scalability and fault tolerance as traffic is not evenly distributed. Stateless microservices with externalized session management are preferred for better scalability.
[More details](https://medium.com/@aditimishra_541/sticky-sessions-an-in-depth-overview-4ec19bd7e22a)

- Trade offs of using sticky session and their alternatives

3C **Benefits Of Austoscaling:**

- Handles varying workloads by dynamically adjusting resources. - Reduces costs by scaling down during low demand. - Enhances fault tolerance and availability by maintaining service levels under high demand.

- **Challenges:**
  - Requires accurate monitoring and load prediction.
  - Latency during scale-up can impact performance.
  - Configuration complexities with cloud platforms and orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

3E - Database sharding divides large databases into smaller, independent pieces (shards) across multiple servers. In microservices, it improves scalability, performance, and fault tolerance by distributing data and load. Each service manages its shard, reducing contention and enabling independent scaling, though it can introduce challenges with data distribution, consistency, and complex queries. [more](https://medium.com/design-microservices-architecture-with-patterns/database-sharding-pattern-for-scaling-microservices-database-architecture-2077a556078)

1J - Using Asynchronous communication using brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ. Service A publishes an event when its processing is done, and Service B consumes the event. Also, Caching can be used to store the out put and used by another. For caching Redis or Memcached used.

- Another Approach is service composition,combines data from multiple microservices
- Using API gateways which can handle tasks like response aggregation,retries and fallback.
