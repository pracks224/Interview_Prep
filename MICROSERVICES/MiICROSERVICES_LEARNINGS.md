To handle latency issues, implement caching to reduce repeated computations, use asynchronous communication and message queues, optimize database queries, compress data transfers, implement load balancing, and monitor network performance. Deploying services closer to users via CDNs or edge computing also minimizes latency.

- A bounded context is a clear boundary within which a particular domain model is defined and applicable. In microservices, it ensures that each service has a well-defined scope, preventing overlapping responsibilities and promoting decoupled and cohesive services. This leads to better scalability, maintainability, and team autonomy.

  - **Use Case Example:** In an e-commerce system, "Order Management" and "Inventory Management" are separate bounded contexts. The "Order Management" service tracks customer orders, while the "Inventory Management" service maintains stock levels. Each service operates independently with its own data model, reducing coupling and simplifying scalability.
