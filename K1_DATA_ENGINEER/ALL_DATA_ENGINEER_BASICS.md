- Three types of DATA JOBS

  - Data Analyst
  - Data Scientist
  - Data Engineers

  #### Data Analyst

- D.A should know Python,Java,sql and any visulization tool like Tableau,Power BI,Quick sight, ClickView etc . E.g. Cricinfo india won for the first t20 after 13 years.

- Data Analysts is the guy who is responsible for derving the insight from Processed Data (SQL/CSV/TSV file) .

#### Data Scientist

- Data Scientist should know Python + SQL + Machine Learning + MLOPS + Gen AI etc. They predicts the future outcome.

- D.S who is responsible for cleaning, manipulating,statistical analysis,predictive analysis,prescrptive analysis, building models and delivering results that has impact on business.

  #### Data Engineer

  - Data Engineers should know Python/Java/Scala + SQL + Cloud + Data Pipeline Skill.
  - Data Engineer Extract,Transform and Load the data Batch/Stream data.
  - D.E who helps the scientist and analyst to get teh golden data . Baically creating data pipeline . Ingestion, removes the null ,processing the data ..like peta byte of data. Backbone of the Data ==> Data Engineer

#### How to become the Data Engineer , Skill Sets needed

##### Infrastrcuture knowledge like VM

- How Networking works
- Load Balancing
- Application Performance Monitoring

##### Cloud Bases Services

AWS|GCP|AZURE|ORACLE etc

##### Database/Datawarehousing

- RDBMS stuffs (Very Very Imporatant)
- NoSQL Databases - Mongo/Casandar/neptune
- Warehouse = Oracle Exadata, GCP Big Query, AWS Redshift

##### Profieciency working with Data Pipeline : GCP Data flow, Apache Bean/Airflow

##### ETL Tools : AWS Glue (Data Lake)

##### Language : SQL,Python/Java, Shell

##### Big Data Processing Tools : Spark, Hadoop, Map Reduce,Kafka

#### What is Big Data ?

- Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, Value,Verbosity (6 Vs).

- #### Volume

It is amount of data that is generated/stored per day .
MB -> GB -> TB -> PB -> EB - ZB 1 PB - 1024 TB

- #### Varierty

3 types of the data

a. Structured

- Follows a rigid format that can be organised into rows and columns very neately. Schema

b. Semi Structured

- Mix of data that has consistent characterstics but that data has not confirm to rigid structure,XML,JSON,Avro,CSV etc .
- It has also table but we dont have data type for the columns like in csv/excel has column name but with out data types. NOSQL - Comes under Semi Structured

c. Un Structured

- Does not have an easly idenifiable strutcure and can not be organized into aany format etc like PDF,text,Videos,Images,Audios,Blobs etc.

Data Engineers has big headache on Un Structure to store etc.

#### Velocity

- It tells the speed at which data is generated.. Batch/Stream etc
- Batch Predefined data is batch like salary processing on month ends etc
- Stream do the analysis then n there . Like the recharge coupon once done block it

#### Veracity

- Quality,accuracy and turn over of Data.Being able to identify the relevance ,correctness or accuracy of data and apply it to appropriate purposes.

- Other V's shortly .

#### Batch Time Analystics Vs Real-Time(Stream) Analytics

- B.T based on the data collected over a period of time is Batch Analytics
- B.T acts on all the data collected over a period of time
- B.T acts on large data set
- Latency of batch processing is in minutes
- Stream based on immediate data for instant result is Real-time Analytics
- Real time acts on the most recent data or the rolling window data
- R.T acts on small size or micro batches of records
- R.T latency of stream processing is in seconds or milli seconds
- R.T stock market, telecommnication,banking,healthcare etc
