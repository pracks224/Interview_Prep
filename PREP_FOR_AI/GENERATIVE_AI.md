# What is GEN - AI?

# Traditional AI vs Generative AI

- Traditional AI based on Pattern recognition, where as GEN AI it creates Patterns based on th einput.
- T . AI makes predictions where as GEN AI creates some thing new
- T. AI rule based where as GEN AI is data driven
- Rules are generated by Human but Gen AI learns from large datasets (Hepta bytes of data).
- Synthetic means generated by AI

# Typical Usecases of GENERATIVE AI

- ChatBots
- DeepFakes
- Scientifc testing
- Product Designs
- Voice over and art works like dubbing movies in different languages
- Document creation
- Music Composition
- Product demonstations
- Chip desig optimization

# What is VAEs (Varitional AutoEncoders) ?

- These are deep learning models
- Used to generate images and speech
- Varional Encoders basically takes human understanble format like images, text, voice ,encoedes it to machine understandable format like matrices and the decode it back to human understanble formats.

- Varitional AE leads to GEN AI , which is based on GANs (Generative Adversial Networks).
- Auto encodes are the newural networks

# GANs

- Two network involved
- One n/w network generates and another provides feedback whthere its right or wrong

# Diffusion Models

-

# Varionional Inefrence

# MLE (Maximum Liklihood estimation)

# Reinforcement learning

# What is Transfer Learning

# Transformers

- Introduced by Google
-

# Language Transformer

A. Encoder Only (BERT )
B. Decoder Only - GPTs ( Chat GPT3 Uses 175 billion paarmeters, Google POM uses 500 billion paramets)
c. Encoder Decoder

# Supervised Learning

# Prompt Tuning or Prompt Engineering

# Adaptors

# Frozen Large Models

# Reinforcement learning

# Future of Generative : Model distilation

# Distrimibative Model :

- These are supevised ML models.
- Condtional Model
- Prdicts of class lables in binary like image of CAT n DOG
- Also, Fincial records decide whethere they eligible for loan
- Few types of DM
  - Logistic Regression
  - Neural Networks
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Condtional random field (CRF)
  - Nearest Neighbours
  - Decision Tree

# Generatibe Models

- Generate new instance of data
- Unsupervised machinlearning
- Distrinctive model only predicts where GEN AI creates new or guess the next
- GEN AI probality of the system
- Common GEN AI models are

  - Bayseian Network
  - Naive Bayes
  - Markov Random Field
  - Hidden Markove model
  - Generative Adversial Network
  - Auto regression Model
  - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

# GANs vs VAEs

- Training : GANs supervised approach VAEs based on un supervised
- Loss Function:

# Workflow of Training Generative Models

- First Step : Understand goal like I am going to generate image or audio or text
- 2nd step: Select the content
- 3rd step: Gather amount of data (clean it , sequence it)
- 4th step :
- 5th step: Apply your model - Generate code - Define layers - Create connections ( use tensor flow or pytorch)
- 6th step : Train your model and adjustments
- 7th step : Assessment and optimization - Quality evaluation -
- 8th step : Tweak and Iterate - Find ways to improve

# Strength and Limitations of Generative models

## Strength

- Automated content writing
- Mimicking humans
- Automated email responses
- Technical query responses
- Information summarization

## Weakneses

- Difficult to find out the sources
- Limited abilities to identify in accuracies
- Tuning in novel instances
- poor bias assessmentns
- Improper represenattion of prejudice

## GEN AI concerns

- Trustworthiness
- Plagiasrism
- Misrepresentations of photographs
- False news
- Cyber warefare - social engineering attacks can utilized
- Search corruption
- Hard to detect AI geneterated content, lack of transparency
-

# Synthetic Data

- Synthetic data refers to data that is artificially generated rather than collected from real-world events or observations. It is typically created using algorithms, simulations, or models to mimic the characteristics of real-world data

- Steps to generate
- Training data -> Correlations -> Data structures -> Statistical Qulaities
- Overfiting prevention while generating syntetic data generation
