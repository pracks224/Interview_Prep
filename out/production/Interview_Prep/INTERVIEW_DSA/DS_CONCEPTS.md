- [Sorting](#sorting)
  - merge two sorted array 2 single sorted array
  - sort an array based on the number of factors e.g 25(no of fators 3),16(5),10(4),9(3) //9,25,10,16
  - Two Arrays A and B ,find no of pairs (i,j) such that A[i]>2.B[j]
  - Sorting strings of lower case characters
  - Find the minimum sub - arry such that if we sort that subarry,then whole array will be sorted e.g. 1,4,2,3,5,6 ===> [1,3]

#### Sorting

- Arranging data in a particular order i.e asc or desc
- A = 3 9 11 13 14 ----> asc
  A = 9 7 6 3 2 -1 ----> desc
- Why do we need sorting ==> Searching becomes very fast
- Stability of Searching Algorithm

- Stable sorting , If multiple objects have same value,then if they appear in the same relative
  order as original array
- Different types of Sorting : Insertion,Selection,Bubble,Merge,Comparator
- Advance sorting like bucket,radix sort,Quick sort
- Why Quick sort is better than Merge Sort ?
