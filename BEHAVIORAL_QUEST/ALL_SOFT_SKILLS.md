1. “When you make healthy choices, self-discipline is strengthened; on the other hand, making unhealthy choices diminishes self-discipline. If you find it difficult to say no to sweet treats, you can’t stick to an exercise routine”-The Power of Discipline: Walter, Daniel

2. “Consistency builds momentum and that’s how dreams become a reality. When you are aware of what discipline demands, you are more likely to choose to do the right thing.”
