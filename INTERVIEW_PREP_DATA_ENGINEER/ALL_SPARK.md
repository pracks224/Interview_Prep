#### Why Spark when Hadoop is already there

- Hadoop is based on Batch processing of large dataset
- Spark is on real time processing power
- Sparks is also 100 time faster than hadoop and map reduce.

#### Feature of Sparks

- Polyglot - Java/R/Python/Scala
- Speed - 100 time fatster than hadoop using partition that helps in paralleize data trafic
- Format - Multiple of data format ,pluggable mechanism
- Lazy evaluation (Key factor),
- Real time computaion ,designed for massive scalabity
- Hadoop integration,spark can run top of hadoop
- Machine learning

#### Who uses Spark ,for what ?

- General purpose framework for cluster computing used for diverse range of applications
-

#### Spark Architecture
