### Mark Doglous Says

#### OBSERVE YOUR SELF

A. ### The process of Consistent is psychological in nature. Not about technical stratergy etc .

- Mistakes are obvious and follow the probability and dont judge your losses or profits.

- Be in the moment

#### SELF DISCIPLINE

- It's a mental technique to redirect our focus of attention to the objective which we desire from other component(beleif).

-

- Have a strong reason for taking a trade, but once you are in a trade, be quick to exit if it doesn’t behave as expected. There is nothing wrong with being dead wrong on a market if you exit the trade with only a small loss.

- “the markets are not an annuity”—you can’t reasonably expect a steady income flow from trading.

- The moral is: Be sure you really want to trade. And don’t confuse wanting to be rich with wanting to trade. Unless you love the endeavor, you are unlikely to succeed.
